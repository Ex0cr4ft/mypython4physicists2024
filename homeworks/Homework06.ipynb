    "1. _The quantity that is conserved in particle interactions is $E_k^2 + (mc^2)^2$ where $E_k$ is particle kinetic energy and $mc^2$ is particle ''mass'' or being more precise the rest energy. A massive particle, like electron, can have zero kinetic energy but will always have a rest energy, therefore a threshold for production of this particle is  $mc^2$._\n",
    "2. _Feynman diagrams are a technique to describe particle interactions. Here it has just an illustrative character but it also has a related mathematical method. You read diagram from left to right. The $p_i$ is a momentum of nucleus before interaction, $p_f$ - after the interaction. $k$ is an incoming photon that produces a pair of leptons, e.g. electron_ ($p_- = e_-$) _and positron_ ($p_+ = e_+$).

Since the energies are spanning across many orders of magnitude, generating a random number in linear space between $0.1$ and $10^6$ keV would introduce a strong bias towards the high energies.
