Homeworks for Python for Physicists (160234-WS 24/25)

Rules:
1. Put your name in the name of the jupyter notebook AND in the corresponding cell in the notebook.
2. Before uploading your homework to Moodle make sure that everything works: Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs of all Cells -> execute all the cells again. Check if your output is still the same!
