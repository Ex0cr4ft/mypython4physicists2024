    "In a galaxy far, far away, there is a planet whose inhabitants are one of the most developed civilizations of the Universe. This alien population is known as \"The Numpyans\", and their planet is \"Arreyu\". The planetary system of which Arreyu is part is very particular because at the center there isn't a star but a black hole known as \"Matrixar\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the centuries, the Numpyans have been polluting their planet Arreyu more and more, so much so that this isn't any more suitable for hosting life. All their technology couldn't do anything against this environmental disaster, but it could still be capable of saving the Numpyans. How? By transferring the whole population to a different planet. Around Matrixar, no other place is suitable for life. Therefore, the Numpyans must go further away in a new planetary system. To do so, they should accelerate their spaceships to very high velocities. The planetary task force for interstellar migration is considering obtaining this acceleration by approaching closely the black hole Matrixar. This acceleration process is known as \"Gravity assist\". The task force is, however, concerned by the tidal forces close to the black hole because they fear they could tear apart the single Numpyan.\n",
